# AzerothCore: PlayerBots module

This module is a port of the [IKE3 PlayerBot module][mangosbot-bots] for MaNGOS.
It is based on the original PlayerBot module by [ZhengPeiRu21][upstream].

The gist is: this is playable, and maintained and kept in sync with
[AzerothCore][AzerothCore]. A patch for the core is provided and kept up to
date, in order to add functions which are needed to run PlayerBots.
